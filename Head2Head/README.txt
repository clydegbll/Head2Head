To run the code: 1. Download the Head2Head.py and matchData.txt files
                 2. Upload the two files to a folder on colab
                 3. Run the proper cells, in order from top to bottom. There are three folders of cells, all of which are labeled:
                                                                                                        1. The import folder, the very first one. Run this one
                                                                                                        2. The API folder, the second. Do not run this folder, as it will throw errors since the API key will be expired.
                                                                                                        3. The data modeling folder, run every cell in here in order, and the formatted output will be printed.
